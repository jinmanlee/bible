    <p>South Korean international superstar Heung-Min Son has endeared himself to the Spurs faithful with some fantastic goalscoring displays since signing from Bayer Leverkusen in August, 2015.</p>
    <p>Scorer of the first Premier League and Champions League goals at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, winner of the 2019/20 FIFA Puskas Award for his wonder goal against Burnley in December, 2019, Sonny simply goes from strength to strength. At the end of 2020/21, he'd scored 107 goals and claimed 64 assists in 280 appearances for us in all competitions. The good news continued into the summer, as well, as Sonny signed a new four-year deal which will run until 2025.</p>
    <p>The 2020/21 campaign was another memorable one for Sonny. He topped the 20-goal mark again with 22 goals in 51 appearances in all competitions - his best seasonal return so far. That included 17 in 37 appearances in the Premier League as he and Harry Kane put together a league record 14 goal combinations for a single season. Sonny scored four goals at Southampton in September, was named the Premier League's EA Sports Player of the Month for October, reached 100 goals for Spurs - only the 18th Spur to do so - and claimed his sixth 'Best Footballer in Asia' award in January. He joined Harry in the PFA's Premier League Team of the Season in June.</p>
